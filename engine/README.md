# Auto-X Engine

The Auto-X Engine is a deep learning inference engine designed for MCUs/CPUs. It is written entirely in C and runs on Auto-X private model format.

This engine only supports the model structures described in this repo at this time.

This repo also demonstrates how to connect ESP32 based cameras/PX4 based drones/Android based Robots to Eclipse Ditto via MQTT using Auto-X Engine.

## Model Pool

> **Note** Because image classification models are rarely used in practical scenarios, we do not privide such kind of models.
> We also provide guidelines and running code to customize and retrain the following models using your own private data.

## Demos

### ESP32-S3-EYE

The ESP32-S3-EYE is a small-sized AI development board produced by Espressif. It is based on the ESP32-S3 SoC and ESP-WHO, Espressifâ€™s AI development framework. It features a 2-Megapixel camera, an LCD display, and a microphone, which are used for image recognition and audio processing. ESP32-S3-EYE offers plenty of storage, with an 8 MB Octal PSRAM and a 8 MB flash. It also supports image transmission via Wi-Fi and debugging through a Micro-USB port. With ESP-WHO, you can develop a variety of AIoT applications, such as smart doorbell, surveillance systems, facial recognition time clock, etc.

Get more information about the hardware at [ESP32-S3-EYE](https://github.com/espressif/esp-who/blob/master/docs/en/get-started/ESP32-S3-EYE_Getting_Started_Guide.md)

This demo simulates the following industrial scenarios:
1. Fix the camera in front of the target objects in COCO dataset categories
2. The camera sends the camera status info. and the recognition results to Auto-X Studio at a fixed interval

###  Raspberry Pi 4 Navio2 Autopilot

Get more information about the hardware at [Navio2](https://navio2.hipi.io/)

This demo simulates the following industrial scenarios:
1. Schedule the drone to autonomously collect images of specified objects at some specified places.
2. Exchange drone status with Auto-X Studio during the flight
3. Upload the collected images to Auto-X Studio when drone goes home

###  Diesease Diagnosis with virtual human agent (Android)
