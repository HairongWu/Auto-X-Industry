Are you still using spreadsheets next to Odoo ?
Frepple is bringing forecasting, inventory planning and production planning capabilities to Odoo.

This odoo addon provides 2-way integration with frePPLe advanced planning.
This repository is composed of 3 modules:
- frepple: This is the core of the connectors to make frepple and odoo exchange data.
- autologin: This module is optional and used to automatically log a user to an Odoo instance. We use this module in our online Odoo demo instances for a better user experience.
- freppledata: This module is optional. It is a sample dataset that we load in our online Odoo demo instances.

Note: To connect a frepple instance to an Odoo instance, ONLY THE FREPPLE MODULE SHOULD BE INSTALLED.
