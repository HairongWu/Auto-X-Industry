# This python script uses the module unittest to run a series of tests.
#
# Each test has its own subdirectory. In the description below it is referred
# to as {testdir}.
# Two categories of tests are supported.
#
#  - Type 1: Run a Python test script
#    If a file runtest.py is found in the test directory, it is being run
#    and its exit code is used as the criterium for a successful test.
#
#  - Type 2: Process an XML or PY file
#    If a file {testdir}.xml or {testdir}.py is found in the test directory, the frepple
#    commandline executable is called to process the file.
#    The test is successful if both:
#      1) the exit code of the program is 0
#      2) the generated output files of the program match the content of the
#         files {testdir}.{nr}.expect
#
#  - If the test subdirectory doesn't match the criteria of any of the above
#    types, the directory is considered not to contain a test.
#
# The script can be run with the following arguments on the command line:
#  - ./runtest.py {test}
#    ./runtest.py {test1} {test2}
#    Execute the tests listed on the command line.
#  - ./runtest.py
#    Execute all tests.
