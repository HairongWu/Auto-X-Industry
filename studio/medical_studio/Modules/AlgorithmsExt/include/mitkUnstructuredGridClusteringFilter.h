  /**
  * @brief This filter uses the DBSCAN algorithm for clustering an
  * mitk::UnstructuredGrid. "MinPts" defines the number of neighbours which are
  * required to be a kernel point if a point is in range of a kernel point
  * but hasn't enough neighbours this point is added to the cluster but is a
  * density reachable point and the cluster ends at this point. "eps" is the
  * range in which the neighbours are searched. If "Meshing" is set the
  * clusteres UnstructuredGrid is meshed and visible in 2D renderwindows.
  *
  * DBSCAN algorithm:
  *
  *     DBSCAN(D, eps, MinPts)
  *     C = 0
  *     for each unvisited point P in dataset D
  *       mark P as visited
  *       N = D.regionQuery(P, eps)
  *       if sizeof(N) < MinPts
  *         mark P as NOISE
  *       else
  *         C = next cluster
  *         expandCluster(P, N, C, eps, MinPts)
  *
  *     expandCluster(P, N, C, eps, MinPts)
  *       add P to cluster C
  *       for each point P' in N
  *         if P' is not visited
  *           mark P' as visited
  *           N' = D.regionQuery(P', eps)
  *           if sizeof(N') >= MinPts
  *             N = N joined with N'
  *         if P' is not yet member of any cluster
  *           add P' to cluster C
