  /** \brief Normalization filter for CEST images.
   *
   * This filter can be used to normalize CEST images, it only works with 4D images and assumes that the input
   * mitk::Image has a property called mitk::CustomTagParser::m_OffsetsPropertyName, with offsets separated by
   * spaces. The number of offsets has to match the number of timesteps.
   *
   * Each timestep with a corresponding offset greater than 299 or less than -299 will be interpreted as normalization (M0) image.
   * If only one M0 image is present normalization will be done by dividing the voxel value by the corresponding
   * M0 voxel value. If multiple M0 images are present normalization between any two M0 images will be done by
   * dividing by a linear interpolation between the two.
   * The M0 images themselves will be removed from the result.
   * The output image will have the same 3D geometry as the input image, a time geometry only consisting of non M0 images and a double pixel type.
