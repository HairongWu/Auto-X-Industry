  /**
  * \brief Calculates features based on the co-occurrence matrix.
  *
  * The co-occurrence matrix describes the relations between voxels in a specific direction. The elements \f$m_{i,k} \f$ of the
  * matrix count how often a voxel with the intensity \f$i \f$ has a neighbour in a certain direction with the intensity \f$ k \f$.
  * The direction for each matrix is given by a directed vector \f$ \overrightarrow{d} \f$.
  *
  * It is important to calculate the matrices for all possible directions in order to obtain a rotation invariant feature.
  * For the 3D case, this means that there are 26 possible directions. Using the symmetrical properties of the co-occurrence
  * matrix, it is then possible to calculate the features in all directions looking at 13 different directions.
  *
  * The standard length of the vector is 1, e.g. looking at direct neighbours. It is possible to look at more
  * distance neighbours. This is achieved using the parameter <b>range</b>  which defines the distance between
  * two neighbouring voxels in number of voxels. The default value for this is 1. It can be changes using the Method
  * SetRange() or by passing the option <b>cooc2::range</b>.
  *
  * There are two possible ways of combining the information obtained from the multiple directions. The first option
  * is to calculate a common matrix for all directions and then use this matrix to calculate the describing features.
  * The second method is to calculate a matrix for each direction, obtain the features and then report the mean and
  * standard value of these features. Both methods are calculated by this filters and reported, distinguisehd by either
  * an "Overall" if a single matrix is used, a "Mean" for the mean Value, or an "Std.Dev." for the standard deviation.
  *
  * The connected areas are based on the binned image, the binning parameters can be set via the default
  * parameters as described in AbstractGlobalImageFeature. The intensity used for the calculation is
  * always equal to the bin number. It is also possible to determine the
  * dimensionality of the neighbourhood using direction-related commands as described in AbstractGlobalImageFeature.
  * No other options are possible beside these two options.
  *
  * This feature calculator is activated by the option <b>-cooccurence2</b> or <b>-cooc2</b>.
  *
  * The features are calculated based on a mask. It is assumed that the mask is
  * of the type of an unsigned short image. All voxels with the value 1 are treated as masked.
  *
  * The following features are defined. We always give the notation for the overall matrix feature
  * although those for the mean and std.dev. are basically equal. In the name, \<Range\> is replace
  * by the distance of the neighbours. For the definitions of the feature, the probability of each
  * intensity pair (i,k) \f$ p_{i,k} = \frac{m_{i,k}}{\sum_i \sum_k m_{i,k}} \f$.
  *
  * In addition, the marginal sum \f$ p_{i,\cdot} = p_{\cdot,k=i} = \sum_k p_{i,k} \f$, which is
  * identical for both axis due to the symmetrical nature of the matrix. Furthermore, the diagonal and
  * cross diagonal features are used:
  * \f[ p_{i-k}(l) = \sum_i \sum_k p_{i,k} \delta(l - \| i -k \| ) \enspace \enspace l = 0, \dots, N_g -1  \f]
  * \f[ p_{i+k}(l) = \sum_i \sum_k p_{i,k} \delta(l - ( i + k ) ) \enspace \enspace l = 2, \dots, 2 N_g \f]
  * Here, \f$ \delta(x) \f$ is the dirac function, which is one for \f$x=0 \f$ and zero otherwise.
