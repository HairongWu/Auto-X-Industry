   @brief Operation, that holds information about some image difference

   This class stores undo information for DiffImageApplier.
   Instances of this class are created e.g. by QmitkSlicesInterpolator.
   This works only for images with 1 channel (gray scale images, no color images).

   ApplyDiffImageOperation of course refers to an image (a segmentation usually).
   The referred image is observed for itk::DeleteEvent, because there is no SmartPointer
   used to keep the image alive -- the purpose of this class is undo and the undo
   stack should not keep things alive forever.

   To save memory, compression is used via CompressedImageContainer.
