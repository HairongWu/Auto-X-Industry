\brief QmitkDataGeneratorBase
BaseClass that implements the organization of (statistic) data generation for pairs of images and ROIs.
The key idea is that this class ensures that for vector of given image ROI pairs (defined by derived classes)
a result instance (e.g ImageStatisticsContainer) will be calculated, if needed (e.g. because it is missing or
not up to date anymore), and stored in the data storage passed to a generator instance. While derived classes i.a.
specify how to generate the image ROI pairs, how to detect latest results, what the next generation step is and
how to remove obsolete data from the storage, the base class takes care of the observation of the data storage
and orchestrates the whole checking and generation workflow.
In all the generation/orchestration process the data storage, passed to the generator, 1) serves as place where the final
results are stored and searched and 2) it resembles the state of the generation process with these final results and WIP
place holder nodes that indicate planed or currently processed generation steps.
