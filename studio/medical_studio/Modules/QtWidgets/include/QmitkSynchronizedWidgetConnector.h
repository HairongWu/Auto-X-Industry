* @brief This class connects different 'QmitkSynchronizedNodeSelectionWidget', such that

*
*        In order to synchronize a new node selection widget with other already connected
*        node selection widgets, 'ConnectWidget(const QmitkSynchronizedNodeSelectionWidget*)' has to be used.
*        In order to desynchronize a node selection widget,
*        'DisconnectWidget(const QmitkSynchronizedNodeSelectionWidget*)' has to be used.
*        If a new node selection has been connected / synchronized,
*        'SynchronizeWidget(QmitkSynchronizedNodeSelectionWidget*' can be used to initialy set
*        the current selection and the current selection mode.
*        For this, both values are stored in this class internally.
