    <h1>WebProtégé Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        We abide by the <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/site/privacy/">Standford Core Privacy Policy</a>. In addition,
        we aide by the policies below.
    </p>

    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>

    <p>
        We reserve the right to share within our research group and with close collaborators at research institutions,
        who help us to improve our software, OBFUSCATED versions of your project
        change history. By obfuscated, we mean that we remove all domain information by replacing entity (class,
        property and individual) names with meaningless identifiers (C1, C2, C3 etc.) and we remove any trace of user
        identifying information, commit messages and absolute timestamps from the change history. Once obfuscated, only
        the original structure of the change history remains. We may use this obfuscated information for research purposes and
        to improve the WebProtégé software.
    </p>

    <p>
        We will NOT share or redistribute any original unobfuscated ontologies or content that you upload to, or edit
        at, webprotege.stanford.edu. This includes project change history, discussion threads, and other project data.
    </p>

    <h2>Account and Data Removal</h2>

    <p>
        The WebProtégé user interface does not offer a mechanism for account or project content removal. If you would
        like us to delete your account and/or project content please send an email to
        webprotege-management@lists.stanford.edu.
